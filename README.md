# CS3780-Software-Security
Final project.

Half the program generates programmer-specified-length passwords randomly and stores them in either a plaintext, hashed, or hashed + salted format file. The other half of the program cracks the passwords and outputs their plain text forms into a file. It times the execution in order to investigate which method of password storage is most secure from brute force attacks.
